NEMS SaaS Probe
===============

This installer will provide the NEMS SaaS Probe. An active NEMS SaaS account is required, and you must also install your nems-saas.bat file, downloadable from within NEMS SaaS.

The NEMS SaaS Probe collects information about your system performance, such as CPU load, memory usage, and disk space. It does not collect any personal information. The data collected is sent to the NEMS SaaS servers over an encrypted connection.

This installer does not connect NEMS SaaS Probe to your account. It only provides the needed sensors. Please also install your nems-saas.bat file to connect the probe to your account.
